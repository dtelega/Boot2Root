This project is an introduction to the penetration of a system.

Step by step guide

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

## We need to fine the IP address of our VM

```ifconfig```

And get something like that:
```vmnet8: flags=8863<UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST> mtu 1500
	ether 00:50:56:c0:00:08
	inet 192.168.152.1 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.152.255
```
(there may be more than 1 vm)

Then use nmap to scan this IP

```nmap 192.168.152.1-255```

And get

```
Starting Nmap 7.70 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2019-01-05 15:43 EET
Nmap scan report for 192.168.152.1
Host is up (0.00015s latency).
Not shown: 999 closed ports
PORT   STATE SERVICE
22/tcp open  ssh

Nmap scan report for 192.168.152.130
Host is up (0.00083s latency).
Not shown: 994 filtered ports
PORT    STATE SERVICE
21/tcp  open  ftp
22/tcp  open  ssh
80/tcp  open  http
143/tcp open  imap
443/tcp open  https
993/tcp open  imaps

Nmap done: 255 IP addresses (2 hosts up) scanned in 28.91 seconds
```
Take the machine with the most open ports.
Our case is ```192.168.152.130```

## Looking for credentials

Install Dirb software
```
git clone https://github.com/v0re/dirb.git
cd dirb/
./configure
make
```
Scan our URL

```
./dirb https://192.168.152.130/ wordlists/common.txt

Research the forum and find 'Probleme login ?' topic, it's logs
Check who log in. Find this:
```
Oct 5 08:45:29 BornToSecHackMe sshd[7547]: Failed password for invalid user !q\]Ej?*5K5cy*AJ from 161.202.39.38 port 57764 ssh2
Oct 5 08:45:29 BornToSecHackMe sshd[7547]: Received disconnect from 161.202.39.38: 3: com.jcraft.jsch.JSchException: Auth fail [preauth]
Oct 5 08:46:01 BornToSecHackMe CRON[7549]: pam_unix(cron:session): session opened for user lmezard by (uid=1040)
```
we suppose that someone put password to login field and then, after couple seconds successfully loged in
So, we try this cred to login the forum ```lmezard/!q\]Ej?*5K5cy*AJ```
Boom! We're here!
